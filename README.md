# Json Engineering with Python

### Learning Concept
Imagine you have a JSON file format from the Software Engineering team, Then you are asked to store the data into your Data Warehouse. &nbsp;
But, as we know we have varied data so need to clean first before storing it in the data warehouse.&nbsp;
This concept requires you to be able to explore all about JSON files, either a normal JSON or Nested JSON.&nbsp;
You should be able to extract and clean the data from JSON files with huge JSON files.

**Illustration Case:**&nbsp;

### Key Objective
- Normal JSON Engineering (Extract, Transform)
- Nested JSON Engineering (Extract, Transform)
- Scalable Code


### Challenge
- Create a python code function that enables fetching data from JSON file with following fields requirements.


### Output

## Installation

Clone this project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdikaalbiyan/self-learning-blank-space.git
```
Make sure python 3.7 was installed on your machine.

Source: https://www.python.org/downloads/

```bash
python --version
```

Create virtualenv *(named venv or etc, up to you)*.
```bash
virtualenv venv
```

Activated python virtual env
```bash
source venv_academi/bin/activate
```

Then install all requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Run Project

Before do run command, configure **source_dir** and **jsonOutputFile** var on ```main.py```.

```python
source_dir = 'YOUR_DIR'
jsonOutputFile = 'YOUR_OUTPUT.json'
```

Run project by typing thin on terminal with active virtualenv:

>python main.py


Just wait for the progress bar to reach 100%


## DONE
