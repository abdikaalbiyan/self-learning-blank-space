# Json Engineering with Python

### Learning Concept
Imagine you have a JSON file format from the Software Engineering team, Then you are asked to store the data into your Data Warehouse. &nbsp;
But, as we know we have varied data so need to clean first before storing it in the data warehouse.&nbsp;
This concept requires you to be able to explore all about JSON files, either a normal JSON or Nested JSON.&nbsp;
You should be able to extract and clean the data from JSON files with huge JSON files.
